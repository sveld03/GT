This repo has 2 primary components: a 1-player game called the "Hard Easy Game" meant to be played on a touchscreen monitor in behavioral experiments, and the Generativity Grapher 2.0. <br /> <br />

The goal of the Hard Easy Game is simple: use the buttons to move the dot from one side of the screen to the other. <br /> 
However, there are a variety of game modes, and in each mode there is a different pattern of button-pressing behavior that will generate successful results. The player is not informed of the pattern. <br />

The Generativity Grapher 2.0 is meant for researchers. <br />
It is a tool that allows the researcher to input various behavioral parameters (extinction rate, reinforcement rate, constants of interaction, etc.), to generate graphs of predicted behaviors. <br />
These graphs are generated by 4 equations derived from operant conditioning principles, which take the parameters as input and output behavioral probability graphs accordingly.
